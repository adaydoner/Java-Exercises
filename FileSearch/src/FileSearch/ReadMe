Main.java start with 3 parameter (homeFolder,port,uri) 
homefolder -> where config files in it 
port -> specified port that you wish to search on files 
uri -> specified uri that you'd like to search on logs


if given port's config file exists, program will search given uri's Location block. 
If uri's log not exists, program will add it. 
If given port's config file doesn't exist program will create a new config file and would add uri's location log.
